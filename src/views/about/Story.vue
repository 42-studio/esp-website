        Threat-Centric Insight
      </h2>

        Cybersecurity is becoming ever more significant.
        With threats that continue to evolve and finite security budgets, maximizing the return on your security investment has never been more important.

        We were driven to start ESProfiler after identifying a common trend across enterprises. An inherent disconnect between the security assets an enterprise owned and the security assets they required.
        Often seeing capability overlap, misconfiguration, and assets that simply failed to counter current threats. Security expenditure was missing efficiency leading to lower levels of overall security.

      <p class="lead">
        We realised that the inability to quantify what a security asset provided was at the core of this issue. If we could answer the question "What do my security assets provide?" we could create a foundation for objective comparison.
        Overlaying threat intelligence, incidents, breach assessments, and more to create a platform for continuous security strategy and investment validation.
